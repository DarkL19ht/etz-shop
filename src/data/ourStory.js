          for entrepreneurship. Their inspiration sprang from a collective
          frustration with the lack of trust and transparency in the local
          market. They had experienced the problem of fake and low-quality
          products and services firsthand, both as consumers and as business
          owners. They wanted to create a solution that would enable consumers
          and businesses to share their honest feedback and reviews, and to
          discover and evaluate the best opportunities near them.`,
